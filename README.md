# T-RexNet - A Hardware-Aware Neural Network for Real-Time Detection of Small Moving Objects

## Introduction
This repository contains a demo of T-RexNet for the specific task of tennis ball tracking.
The pretrained network is provided for easy usage.
The program takes in input the video of a tennis match and outputs a new video where a bounding box is drawn around the detected tennis ball.
The full paper can be found at https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/4/1252/pdf.

T-RexNet has been implemented in Python, version 3.6.9, using the TensorFlow library,version 1.14. 

## Usage
Just clone this repository and substitute the input video with the video you want to perform tennis ball tracking on.
For best performance, given the way T-RexNet works, the camera has to be static.
