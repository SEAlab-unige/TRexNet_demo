# T-RexNet - A Hardware-Aware Neural Network for Real-Time Detection of Small Moving Objects

## Introduction
This repository contains a demo of T-RexNet for the specific task of tennis ball tracking.
The pretrained network is provided for easy usage.

## Usage
Just clone this repository and substitute the input video with the video you want to perform tennis ball tracking on.
For best performance, given the way T-RexNet works, the camera has to be static.
